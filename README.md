# List-to-Dictionary

List to dictionary is a rather easy concept to code but the kind of application this has is immense. I am sure the same is true for all of python but I don't know it all yet. 

What I have done in this commit is tried to convert 2 lists into a key value pair in a dictionary. I have used 3 different methods to do it. 

1. Nested for loop which runs for both lists one element at a time to give a result of a dictoinary.
2. Simple for loop which runs for the range of the length of the Key List.
3. Using a zip() function.

I will be using this concept on one of my eariler scripts to build something really fun. I'll keep updating.
